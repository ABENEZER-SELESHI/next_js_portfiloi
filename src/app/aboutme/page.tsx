        ABOUT ME
      </h1>
      <p className="font-[lato]">
        My name is Abenezer Seleshi, and I am a passionate software engineering
        student at ASTU with a strong interest in programming. I love the
        process of problem-solving through code and constantly seek to improve
        my skills. I am always excited to learn new languages and technologies,
        as I believe that expanding my knowledge is key to becoming a better
        developer. With each project, I gain valuable experience, and I look
        forward to tackling more challenges that help me grow both personally
        and professionally. My enthusiasm for learning drives me to continuously
        explore and innovate in the field of software engineering.
